                                    observation tower located in the Shiba-koen district of Minato, Tokyo, Japan. At 333 metres 
                                    (1,093 ft), it is the second-tallest structure in Japan. The structure is an Eiffel Tower-inspired 
                                    lattice tower that is painted white and international orange to comply with air safety regulations.
                                    Built in 1958, the tower's main sources of revenue are tourism and antenna leasing. Over 150 
                                    million people have visited the tower since its opening. FootTown, a four-story building located 
                                    directly under the tower, houses museums, restaurants and shops. Departing from there, guests can 
                                    visit two observation decks. The two-story Main Observatory is located at 150 metres (490 ft), 
                                    while the smaller Special 
                                    Observatory reaches a height of 250 metres (820 ft).

                                    is an independent Buddhist temple in eastern Kyoto. The temple is part of the Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto 
                                    (Kyoto, Uji and Otsu Cities) UNESCO World Heritage site. Kiyomizu-dera was founded in the early Heian period. The 
                                    temple was founded in 798, and its present buildings were constructed in 1633, ordered by the Tokugawa Iemitsu. 
                                    There is not a single nail used in the entire structure. It takes its name from the waterfall within the complex, 
                                    which runs off the nearby hills. Kiyomizu means clear water, or pure water.
                                    It was originally affiliated with the old and influential Hossō sect dating from Nara times. However, in 1965 it 
                                    severed that affiliation, and its present custodians call themselves members of the "Kitahossō" sect.<br />

                                <div id="light3" class="white_content"><h3>Tokyo Disneyland (東京ディズニーランド Tōkyō Dizunīrando)</h3> is an 115-acre 
                                    (465,000 m2) theme park at the Tokyo Disney Resort in Urayasu, Chiba, Japan, near Tokyo. Its main gate is directly 
                                    adjacent to both Maihama Station and Tokyo Disneyland Station. It was the first Disney park to be built outside 
                                    the United States, and it opened on April 15, 1983. The park was constructed by Walt Disney Imagineering in the 
                                    same style as Disneyland in California and Magic Kingdom in Florida. It is owned by The Oriental Land Company, 
                                    which licenses the theme from The Walt Disney Company. Tokyo Disneyland and its companion park, Tokyo DisneySea, 
                                    are the only Disney parks not wholly or partially owned by the Walt Disney Company.
                                    There are seven themed areas in the park: the World Bazaar; the four classic Disney lands: Adventureland, 
                                    Westernland, Fantasyland and Tomorrowland; and two mini-lands: Critter Country and Mickey's Toontown. Many of 
                                    the games and rides in these areas mirror those in the original Disneyland as they are based on American Disney 
                                    films and fantasies. Fantasyland includes Peter Pan's Flight, Snow White's Scary Adventures, Dumbo the Flying 
                                    Elephant and more based on classic Disney films and characters. The park is noted for its extensive open spaces, 
                                    to accommodate the large crowds that visit the park. In 2013, Tokyo Disneyland hosted 17.2 million visitors, 
                                    making it the world's second-most visited theme park behind the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World Resort. <br />

                                shrine of Inari, located in Fushimi-ku, Kyoto, Japan. The shrine sits at the base of a mountain 
                                also named Inari which is 233 metres above sea level, and includes trails up the mountain to many 
                                smaller shrines which span 4 kilometers and takes approximately 2 hours to walk up.
                                Since early Japan, Inari was seen as the patron of business, and merchants and manufacturers have 
                                traditionally worshipped Inari. Each of the torii at Fushimi Inari Taisha is donated by a Japanese 
                                business. First and foremost, though, Inari is the god of rice.
                                This popular shrine is said to have as many as 32,000 sub-shrines (bunsha (分社) throughout Japan.<br />
